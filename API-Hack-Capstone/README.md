Responsive web app that helps users decide where to order dinner and which movie to watch for a fun night in.  Users input their location and it is sent to the [EatStreet API Endpoint](https://developers.eatstreet.com/endpoint/search) to find restaurants that provide food delivery or pickup nearby. Users will then navigate to a screen where they can input a movie that they like so that they can receive similar movie recommendations using the [TasteDive Movie API Endpoint](https://tastedive.com/read/api)

A link to your live app
Screenshot(s) of your app. This makes your app description much easier to understand.
A summary section. This should have a concise explanation of what your app does. Try to frame this from the standpoint of what the user does, or what the app enables for the user.
