## Motivation

Sometimes you just want a nice relaxing night in, while ordering dinner and watching a good movie.  There are so many restaurants and movies to choose from, and it can be very hard to make a selection.  This app was created to help users avoid the decision paralysis that happens when they need to deicde on a resturaunt to eat at, or when they need to decide on a movie to watch. First, the user will input their location and the app will show the information for a takeout restaurant nearby.  Then the user will input a movie that they like and the app will show them a recommendation and trailer for a similar movie.

## Summary

<b>Dinner and a Movie</b> is a responsive web app that helps users decide where to order dinner and which movie to watch for a fun night in.  Users input their location and it is sent to the [EatStreet API Endpoint](https://developers.eatstreet.com/endpoint/search) to find restaurants that provide food delivery or pickup nearby. Users will then navigate to a screen where they can input a movie that they like so that they can receive similar movie recommendations using the [TasteDive Movie API Endpoint](https://tastedive.com/read/api)

### With a little bit of CSS

After researching the <i>Psychology of Color</i>, I decide that I would either choose a red or orange color scheme for my styling.  Red, because it symbolizes entertainment, for the movie portion of the app. Or orange, because it symbolizes food/hunger, for the food delivery portion of the app.  I ended up with a red based color theme from Adobe called,  [Sosialisasi Speak Up 19](https://color.adobe.com/Sosialisasi-Speak-Up-19-color-theme-14114879/https://color.adobe.com/Sosialisasi-Speak-Up-19-color-theme-14114879/) , which can be viewed below.
