<!-- A community driven, book recommendation application. Users can create lists of their favorite books and have others recommended to them.
A link to your live app
Screenshot(s) of your app. This makes your app description much easier to understand.
A summary section. This should have a concise explanation of what your app does. Try to frame this from the standpoint of what the user does, or what the app enables for the user.
A section on the technology used. For your capstone, this is fairly simple (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery) but it's still good to list out the key technologies.
