## Motivation

Sometimes you just want a nice relaxing night in, while ordering dinner and watching a good movie.  There are so many restaurants and movies to choose from, and it can be very hard to make a selection when there are so many good options.  This app was created to help users avoid the decision paralysis that happens when they need to deicde on a resturaunt to eat at, or when they need to decide on a movie to watch. The users will input thier location and the app will show the information for a takeout restaurant nearby.  Then the user will input a movie that they like and the app will show them a recommendation and trailer for a similar movie.

## Summary

Responsive web app that helps users decide where to order dinner and which movie to watch for a fun night in.  Users input their location and it is sent to the [EatStreet API Endpoint](https://developers.eatstreet.com/endpoint/search) to find restaurants that provide food delivery or pickup nearby. Users will then navigate to a screen where they can input a movie that they like so that they can receive similar movie recommendations using the [TasteDive Movie API Endpoint](https://tastedive.com/read/api) 

//A summary section. This should have a concise explanation of what your app does. Try to frame this from the standpoint of what the user does, or what the app enables for the user.

After researching the Psychology of Color, I decide that I would either choose a red or orange color scheme for my styling.  Red, because it symbolizes entertainment, for the movie portion of the app. Or Orange, because it symbolizes food/hunger, for the food delivery portion of the app.  I ended up with a red based color scheme called,  [Color theme: Adobe Sosialisasi Speak Up 19](https://color.adobe.com/Sosialisasi-Speak-Up-19-color-theme-14114879/https://color.adobe.com/Sosialisasi-Speak-Up-19-color-theme-14114879/) , which you can view below.
